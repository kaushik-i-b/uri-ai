# Connection Refused Error Fix

## Issue Summary

The application was failing to accept connections on Fly.io with the following error:

```
instance refused connection. is your app listening on 0.0.0.0:8080? make sure it is not only listening on 127.0.0.1
```

This error occurs when the application is only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0), or when there's a port mismatch between what Fly.io expects (8080) and what the application is using.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we identified several potential issues:

1. **Port Mismatch**: The .env file was setting PORT=8000, while the Dockerfile and fly.toml were using PORT=8080.

2. **Configuration Exclusion**: The .dockerignore file was excluding fly.toml, which meant the application didn't have access to the correct PORT setting when deployed.

3. **No Explicit Host Binding**: The application didn't have a main block to explicitly start the server on 0.0.0.0:8080 when run directly.

## Changes Made

We made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Updated .dockerignore**:
   - Removed fly.toml from the excluded files to ensure the application has access to the correct PORT setting when deployed.

2. **Updated .env File**:
   - Changed PORT from 8000 to 8080 to be consistent with the Dockerfile and fly.toml.

3. **Enhanced main.py**:
   - Added a main block that explicitly starts the server on 0.0.0.0:8080 when the application is run directly.
   - This ensures the application listens on all network interfaces and the correct port, regardless of how it's started.

## How These Changes Fix the Issue

1. **Consistent Port Configuration**: By ensuring that the PORT environment variable is set to 8080 in all configuration files (Dockerfile, fly.toml, .env), we eliminate any confusion about which port the application should use.

2. **Proper File Inclusion**: By removing fly.toml from .dockerignore, we ensure that the application has access to the correct PORT setting when deployed.

3. **Explicit Host Binding**: By adding a main block to main.py that explicitly starts the server on 0.0.0.0:8080, we ensure that the application listens on all network interfaces and the correct port, regardless of how it's started.

These changes ensure that the application is accessible from outside the container, which is essential for Fly.io deployments.

## Verification

The changes have been made and documented in the FLY_IO_DEPLOYMENT.md file. After deploying these changes to Fly.io, the application should be accessible and no longer refuse connections.

## Recommendations for Future Deployments

1. **Consistent Configuration**: Ensure that environment variables like PORT are consistently set across all configuration files.

2. **Explicit Host Binding**: Always explicitly bind to 0.0.0.0 (all network interfaces) rather than relying on the default 127.0.0.1 (localhost only).

3. **Careful .dockerignore Configuration**: Be cautious about excluding important configuration files like fly.toml in .dockerignore.

4. **Documentation**: Keep deployment documentation up-to-date with any changes to the deployment process or configuration.

By following these recommendations, you can avoid similar issues in the future and ensure smooth deployments to Fly.io.
