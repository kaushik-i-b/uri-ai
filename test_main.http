  "user_input": "I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately. It started about three months ago when I began a new job. The pressure is intense, and I find myself worrying constantly about deadlines and making mistakes. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. During the day, I have trouble concentrating on tasks because my mind keeps jumping to all the things that could go wrong. I've tried deep breathing and meditation, but they only help temporarily. I'm eating less than usual and have lost some weight. My friends have noticed that I'm more withdrawn and don't join social activities as much as before. I'm wondering if this is just normal stress or if it might be an anxiety disorder. What do you think? What strategies might help me manage these feelings better?",
